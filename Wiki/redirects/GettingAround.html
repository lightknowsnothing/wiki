    <li>By Road</li>
    Gujarat offers various convenient options for getting around, whether you’re traveling between cities or exploring within them. From modern highways to efficient public transport, moving around Gujarat is generally smooth and accessible.
    
    <p> <b> &nbsp;&nbsp; ->Buses:</b><br>
     The Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation (GSRTC) operates an extensive network of buses, including luxury, express, and ordinary services, connecting all major cities and towns. Private bus operators also offer comfortable options for long-distance travel.
    </p>

    <p> <b> &nbsp;&nbsp; ->Taxis and Cabs:</b><br>
        Taxis are readily available in all major cities. App-based services like **Ola** and **Uber** are operational in cities like Ahmedabad, Surat, and Vadodara. For more remote areas, local taxi services are available, and hiring a car with a driver for a day is a common practice.   
    </p>

    <p> <b> &nbsp;&nbsp; ->Self-Drive:</b><br>
        Car rental services are available in cities like Ahmedabad and Surat for those who prefer to drive. Gujarat’s highways and roads are generally in good condition, making self-driving a viable option for exploring the state at your own pace.
    </p>
    <br> <br>
    <li>By Train</li>
    Gujarat has a well-developed local and intercity rail network. While the state is primarily known for its connectivity to other parts of India via long-distance trains, some cities also have local suburban train services. Ahmedabad and Vadodara are key railway junctions for intercity travel within Gujarat.    
    <br> <br>
    <li>By Air</li>
    While air travel is not commonly used for intra-state transport due to the relatively short distances between most cities, there are domestic flights connecting major cities like Ahmedabad, Surat, Rajkot, and Vadodara. If you need to travel long distances in a short amount of time, flying between these cities is an option.
    <br> <br>
    <li>By Metro (Ahmedabad)</li>
    Ahmedabad has a rapid transit system, the Ahmedabad Metro, which is still expanding but serves as a quick way to get around certain parts of the city. It is ideal for avoiding traffic congestion in the bustling urban areas.
    <br> <br>
    <li>By Auto-Rickshaw</li>
    Auto-rickshaws are an affordable and popular means of transport in almost all cities and towns across Gujarat. They are especially convenient for short trips. In most cities, auto-rickshaws operate on a metered fare system, but you may need to negotiate fares in smaller towns.
    <br> <br>
    <li>By Cycle-Rickshaw</li>
    In some older parts of cities like Ahmedabad and Vadodara, cycle-rickshaws offer a slower but scenic way to travel, especially in narrow streets and markets. Though not as fast, they provide a unique experience, allowing travelers to soak in the local vibe.
